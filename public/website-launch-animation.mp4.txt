/* Note: This is a placeholder file with instructions.
   Please create and add an actual video file named 'website-launch-animation.mp4' to your public folder. 
   
   Alternatives if you don't have a video:
   1. Find a suitable website launch/development animation on a stock video site
   2. Create a simple animation with blue hues showing a website build process
   3. Use a GIF instead and modify the component to use an image instead of video
